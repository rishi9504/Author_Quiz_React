Author Quiz

This app is stepping stone of React for me. I made this app following the "Pluralsight Intro to React" Course. In this application I will try to add timer for correct prediction time and option for adding bulk questions.
This app is made with help of https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app .

For the application to run in the local we need to have Node.js installed in the local.
After the Node installation clone the application in the directory of your choice. 
After cloning the repository change into the application directory.
Open a command prompt/terminal in the same directory. 
Run npm install for the application to install.
Run npm start for application to start on localhost.
